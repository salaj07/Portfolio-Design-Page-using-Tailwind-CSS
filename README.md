# Portfolio Design Page using Tailwind CSS

This is a **static portfolio design page** created using **Tailwind CSS**.  
The page focuses purely on layout, styling, and structure — it's not a complete functional website or portfolio (yet!).  
It's built as a part of frontend design practice using Tailwind's utility-first approach.
